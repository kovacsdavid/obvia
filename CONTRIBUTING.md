## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions to this repository must comply with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). This is a simple statement that you, the contributor, have the legal right to submit your work under the project's license.

### What is the DCO?

The DCO is a declaration you make by adding a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit messages. This certifies that you wrote the code or otherwise have the right to submit it.

The full text of the DCO is available in the [DCO](./DCO) file in this repository, or at [developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org/).

### How to Sign Off Your Commits

You must add a `Signed-off-by` line to each commit message. This can be done automatically by using the `-s` flag with `git commit`:

```
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```

This will add something like this to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

**Pull requests with unsigned commits will not be merged.**
